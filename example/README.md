This code was developed for an Arduino Nano ESP32 and shows part of main.cpp (or an .ino file) and indicates how to light the board's blue LED when the JMRI hub is connected.  

It also allows code to be run when the hub is connected which may be used to send the current state of events to JMRI when the hub is first connected or is reconnected.
